Do a lots of things such as "CRUD" where user can create, read, update and delete the content mainly on the menu sides which will affecting

## Onto the selling point which is the QR-Code
The QR code is being used on each client side table and actually the qr code is using a parameter representing each table number
like 1,2,3 and so on. But of course there would be some vulnerabilities mainly on the part of the table number which could be used
on client side ==HIJACKING== which could be an issue but already mitigated using LARAVEL built in encryption technology.
